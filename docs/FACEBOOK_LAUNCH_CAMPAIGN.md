## POST #1: The Announcement
**Best Time:** Tuesday or Thursday, 7-9 PM

---

**Option A: Direct & Personal**

> I've been working on something for the past year that I'm finally ready to share.
>
> It started with a simple question: *What stories will die with you?*
>
> My [grandmother/grandfather/parent] passed away and I realized I never recorded their stories. The recipes they made. The struggles they overcame. The wisdom they earned. Gone.
>
> So I built something. It's called **Origins** — an AI-powered app that helps families capture and preserve their life stories.
>
> You talk to an AI named Ori (like having a conversation with a thoughtful friend), and it turns your memories into a beautiful memoir. You can even clone a loved one's voice so their stories can be read in their own voice. Forever.
>
> I'm looking for **10 families** to try it for free and help me make it better.
>
> If you have a parent, grandparent, or family member whose story deserves to be told — comment below or DM me.
>
> This is personal to me. I don't want anyone else to feel the regret I felt.

---

**Option B: Question Hook**

> Quick question for my friends and family:
>
> If you could sit down with your grandparents (or parents) and record their entire life story — every struggle, every triumph, every piece of wisdom — would you?
>
> What if an AI could guide that conversation, ask the right questions, and turn it into a beautiful memoir your grandchildren could read?
>
> What if you could preserve their actual voice, so future generations could hear them tell their own story?
>
> I built this. It's called **Origins**.
>
> Looking for 10 families to try it FREE. Comment "STORY" if interested.

---

**Option C: Vulnerability Hook**

> I have a confession.
>
> My [grandmother] died 3 years ago and I never recorded her story.
>
> She survived [the Depression / immigration / raising 6 kids alone / etc.]. She had wisdom I'll never hear again. Recipes I'll never taste. Stories my kids will never know.
>
> That regret haunted me. So I built something about it.
>
> **Origins** — an app that helps families capture life stories before it's too late.
>
> - Talk naturally (no writing required)
> - AI asks the questions you'd forget to ask
> - Creates shareable video clips
> - Can even clone their voice for future generations
>
> I need 10 families to test it. Completely free. You keep everything.
>
> Who has a parent or grandparent whose story needs to be told?

---

## POST #2: The Story (Personal)
**Post 2-3 days after Post #1**

---

> A few people asked me why I'm building Origins. Here's the real story.
>
> [INSERT YOUR PERSONAL STORY HERE — make it specific and emotional]
>
> Examples:
> - "My grandmother used to tell me about walking 5 miles to school in Poland..."
> - "My dad never talked about Vietnam until he was 70..."
> - "I found a box of letters my grandfather wrote during WWII..."
>
> That moment made me realize: **every family has stories worth preserving.**
>
> Not because they're famous. Because they're *yours*.
>
> Your kids deserve to know where they came from. Your grandkids deserve to hear your voice.
>
> That's why I built Origins. That's why I'm asking for your help testing it.
>
> Still looking for a few more families. DM me if you're interested.

## POST #3: The Ask

## POST #4: Social Proof
**Post after first family completes their story**

---

> [SHARE A STORY CLIP VIDEO]
>
> This is why I built Origins.
>

## COMMENT RESPONSES

When people comment, respond quickly and personally:

**If they say "Interested" / "Tell me more":**
> Thanks [Name]! I'll DM you the details. Quick question — would this be for capturing your own story or a parent/grandparent's?

**If they tag someone:**
> Love this! [Tagged person] — would love to help you capture your family's story. I'll send you both a message.

**If they share a personal story:**
> This is exactly why I built this. [Acknowledge their specific story]. Would love to help you preserve this. DMing you now.

**If they ask about price:**
> For beta testers, it's completely free — and you keep lifetime access. I just need your feedback to make it better before launch.

---

## DM SCRIPT

When someone expresses interest, send this:

---

> Hey [Name]! Thanks for your interest in Origins.
>
> Quick background: I built this because I regret not recording my [grandmother's] stories before she passed. I don't want anyone else to feel that.
>
> Here's how it works:
>
> 1. You (or your family member) talk to Ori — our AI guide
> 2. Ori asks thoughtful questions and captures the story
> 3. We turn it into a memoir with photos, timeline, and shareable clips
> 4. Optional: We can clone their voice so the story is read in their voice
>
> For beta testers:
> - Completely free (normally $9.99/month)
> - You keep everything forever
> - I just need 30 min of your time and honest feedback
>
> Sound good? I can set you up today.
>
> Who would be telling their story — you, a parent, or grandparent?

---

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

**If no response after 24 hours:**
> Hey [Name] — just following up! Still have a spot for you if you're interested. No pressure either way.

**If no response after 3 days:**
> Last check-in! Closing beta spots this week. Let me know if timing is bad — happy to save you a spot for later.

## TRACKING SPREADSHEET

Create a simple tracker:

| Name | Relationship | Status | Story Subject | Clip Created | Testimonial |
|------|--------------|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| | | Interested / Scheduled / Completed | | Yes/No | Yes/No |

## SUCCESS METRICS

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|

## CONTENT TO CREATE FROM BETA

From each family, capture:

2. **Quote testimonial** (1-2 sentences)
3. **Before/after** ("I never knew X about my mom until...")
4. **Photo** (family with printed book or using app)

This becomes your marketing fuel for public launch.
